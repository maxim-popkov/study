<strong>Generation of Realistic Tabular data</strong>
<br> with pretrained Transformer-based language models
</p>

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

Our GReaT framework utilizes the capabilities of pretrained large language Transformer models to synthesize realistic tabular data. 
New samples are generated with just a few lines of code, following an easy-to-use API. Please see our [publication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06280) for more details. 

## GReaT Installation

The GReaT framework can be easily installed using with [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/): 
```bash
pip install be-great
```



## GReaT Quickstart

In the example below, we show how the GReaT approach is used to generate synthetic tabular data for the California Housing dataset.
```python
from be_great import GReaT
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_california_housing

data = fetch_california_housing(as_frame=True).frame

model = GReaT(llm='distilgpt2', epochs=50)
model.fit(data)
synthetic_data = model.sample(n_samples=100)
```
